          When you post your services online, you will get more customers for your business. Sometimes it may happen that people closer to you have different demands and you are not finding scope for your service, so people start finding  their tasks at different platforms and start finding serives providers like us and people send offers and the Team of All Essentials  will review your profile and help to find best service provider for your  work. In that case online selling is way out of it as it gives your service a chance to explore the audience for it. 
          Thus one can find the right audience for its services.
